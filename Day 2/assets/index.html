                        Most of my CS experience is in Python, Java, and C++, so I'm excited to explore the frontend side of things.</p>

                    <p class="text-light"> In my free time, I like to read books, watch shows, play video games, and study philosophy and psychology.
                        I've surprised myself recently because I've been able to motivate myself and communicate better by applying things I've learned from psychology.
                        I'm thinking about creating a website for a blog where I analyze cartoons / shows / other fiction psychologically.</p>

                    <p class="text-light"> I'm excited to gain experience collaborating with a team and contributing to a project that has a social impact, and I hope to have lots of fun! </p>

                                    I find myself looking up to Sherlock because of his quick wits in dangerous situations. He's the epitome of on-the-fly thinking.
