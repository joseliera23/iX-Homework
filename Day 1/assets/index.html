                        Hi! I'm a rising senior at Harvey Mudd College, joint-majoring in Computer Science and Math.
                        Most of my CS experience is in Python, Java, and C++, so I'm excited to explore the frontend side of things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I like to read books, watch shows, play video games, and study philosophy and psychology.
                        I've surprised myself recently because I've been able to motivate myself and communicate better after applying psychological advice I've explored on my own,
                        and I'm thinking about creating a website for a blog where I do a psychological analysis on cartoons/shows/other fiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited to gain experience collaborating with a team and contributing to a project that has a social impact, and despite a rough first week, I hope to catch up and have lots of fun!
                    </p>
